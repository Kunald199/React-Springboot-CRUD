# React-Springboot-CRUD
Application demonstrating CRUD operations using React, Spring Boot, REST API


**frontend** folder contains React code
**REST CRUD** folder contains Spring Boot code

Note: REST CRUD also contains some extra (not required) implementation on port 8081.



To see this project working make sure your server is up and running (starting springboot application) and use command "npm start" when you are in the frontend folder
